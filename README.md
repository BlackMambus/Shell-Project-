# Shell-Project-

A shell is a user interface that allows you to interact with an operating system—typically through text commands. It's like a translator between you and your computer’s kernel (the core of the OS), enabling tasks like file manipulation, program execution, and system monitoring.

⚙️ Key Roles of a Shell

Command Execution: Run programs and scripts directly from text input

Scripting: Automate tasks using shell scripts (e.g. backup, installation, setup)

Environment Control: Set variables and configure settings for programs

Input/Output Redirection: Channel outputs between files, commands, and devices

Process Management: Start, stop, and monitor system processes
